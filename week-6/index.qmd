In this module, we will learn more about data visualization and the
basics behind it. Visualization is an essential part of exploratory data
analysis, enabling faster comprehension, better decision-making, and
more impactful storytelling with data.

Text analysis is not just about collecting data, it's about transforming
raw data into meaningful insights, knowledge, and ultimately, impact.
However, misinterpretation or excessive manipulation can lead to
misleading conclusions.

In this lecture, we will explore:

-   The journey from raw data to actionable insights
-   How to structure and interpret data effectively
-   Turning insights into meaningful decisions

Please note that throughout this lecture, when I use the term “data,” I
am using it as a broad, umbrella term. In this context, it explicitly
includes textual data (such as documents, social media posts, articles,
transcripts, and any other forms of text) that we analyze using IR, NLP,
or text mining techniques.

::: notes
Exploratory data analysis, or EDA, is a crucial step in the data
analysis process, allowing analysts to understand the structure,
patterns, and relationships within datasets.

Exploratory data analysis involves the initial exploration and
examination of data to gain insights and formulate hypotheses. It
includes techniques such as summary statistics and data visualization.

EDA has plenty of benefits as a form of data analysis. Let's examine
some of them:

-   One benefit is that EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of
    the characteristics and distributions of variables within the data
    set.
-   It can also help identify outliers, which are missing values and
    data inconsistencies that may affect some subsequent analysis.
-   Finally, EDA facilitates the generation of hypotheses and
    formulation of research questions based on observed patterns and
    trends.

Visualizations are an important component of EDA, allowing analysts to
explore the relationships between variables and uncover patterns
visually.

Techniques such as histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots are commonly
used to visualize data distributions and relationships.

Let's explore some key benefits of using visualizations in exploratory
data analysis:

-   Visualizations make complex datasets more accessible and
    understandable, enabling stakeholders to grasp valuable insights
    quickly.
-   Visualizations also help when trying to detect patterns, trends, and
    outliers that may not be apparent from numerical summaries alone.
-   Another benefit is that they support data driven decision making.
    They do this by providing compelling visual evidence to support
    hypotheses and conclusions.

Exploratory data analysis is a starting point when working with a set of
data and is less structured than more in depth analysis, as the intent
is to just find initial ideas to explore further.

With that in mind, there are some limitations to exploratory data
analysis:

-   One is that it can be very time consuming when first examining data
    with no idea where to start.
-   Digging through the pile of data and trying different combinations
    of variables to evaluate can take a significant amount of time.
-   Another is that it can be misleading or incomplete.

Initial impressions of the data being analyzed can indicate one
conclusion or way of thinking that may be invalidated as more data is
uncovered and evaluated and the findings and methods can be difficult to
communicate or reproduce.

Exploratory data analysis is less structured than a more in depth
investigation into a specific finding, so depending on the methods taken
and the amount of documentation generated about the way the data was
analyzed, it can be very hard to explain or share what was found.

In summary, exploratory data analysis is a critical phase in the data
analysis process, providing valuable insights into the structure and
characteristics of datasets.

While EDA has its advantages and limitations, when conducted
effectively, it serves as a foundational step for further analysis and
hypothesis formulation.

::: notes
The saying *"A picture is worth a thousand words"* holds true in data
analysis because our brains are naturally wired to process visual
information quickly and efficiently.

Instead of sifting through raw numbers, visual representations such as
graphs, charts, and plots help us absorb information at a glance.

Through visualization, we can easily identify patterns, trends, and
outliers through thoughtful visual **encoding** that might otherwise be
overlooked in tabular data. It allows us to connect the dots between
different variables, uncover hidden relationships, and gain meaningful
insights.

Additionally, visualization is a valuable tool for sharing findings, as
it makes complex data more accessible and engaging for others.

Whether presenting data to a technical audience or a general audience,
clear and well-designed visuals help communicate insights effectively
and capture attention.

## Why Create Visualizations Generally? {.smaller}

`Most information visualizations are acts of interpretation masquerading as presentation. In other words, they are images that act as if they are just showing us what is, but in actuality, they are arguments made in graphical form (Johanna Drucker)`

::: notes
Data visualization helps the user make sense of large (and often times
small) amounts of data using computational and analytic tools. In
academic and special libraries data visualization helps researchers and
business users recognize and understand the “patterns” in the data to
assist them in decision making, research, product development,
marketing, and other uses not yet realized.

Along with the emergence of “big data” came the need for more visual
means to analyze and make sense of the data. Visualization also allows
for re-purposing of datasets beyond their original use.

Information professionals assist in data visualization but also in
managing and preparing the data for use.

An academic library may title these professionals as Data analysis
librarian, Data manager, Digital Projects librarian/specialist, etc. The
titles are emerging as fast as the visualization tools themselves.
Special librarians have always conducted data analysis and competitive
intelligence for their companies. Data visualization is an extension of
this service to their user community.

Information professionals also use data visualization themselves for
innovative ways to present information to users, to market their
services, and to synthesize data for stakeholders.

::: notes
Data visualization comes in various forms, each serving a specific
purpose depending on the type of data being analyzed and the insights we
seek. There are many types of visualization that you can choose from
once you know more about your data after the EDA process.

Some of the most common ones are:

1.  **Histograms** display the distribution of numerical data, helping
    us understand the frequency and spread of values.

2.  **Bar charts** are useful for comparing categorical data, showing
    differences between groups or trends over time.

3.  **Pie charts** are commonly used for showing proportions, though
    they are best for simple comparisons rather than detailed analysis.

4.  **Line charts** are effective for tracking changes and trends,
    especially in time-series data.

5.  **Scatter plots** help visualize relationships between two numerical
    variables, making it easier to identify correlations and patterns.

6.  More advanced visualizations include **heatmaps**, which use color
    intensity to represent data values and highlight patterns across a
    matrix, and **box plots**, which summarize data distribution,
    outliers, and variability.

7.  **Tree maps** and **word clouds** are great for hierarchical and
    text-based data, respectively.

Choosing the right visualization depends on the data and the story we
want to tell, as each type enhances our ability to interpret information
and make informed decisions.

## One-Variable Graph {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Histogram** shows distribution and concentration of data

-   **Bar Plot** compares the same variable across different groups and
    shows how the data distributed among the groups

-   **Pie Chart** shows the groups of what your data is made, allows you
    to see the most and least as well as everything in-between, and
    shows the distribution of the data among groups

::: notes
One-variable visualization, also known as **univariate visualization**,
focuses on analyzing a single variable to understand its distribution,
central tendency, and spread. A common method for visualizing
one-variable data is a **histogram**, which groups numerical data into
bins and displays the frequency of values within each bin. This helps us
see patterns such as whether the data is normally distributed, skewed,
or contains outliers.

**Bar charts** are another option when dealing with categorical data,
showing the frequency of different categories using bars of varying
heights.

Using these visualizations, we can quickly interpret key characteristics
of a dataset, such as its shape, spread, and any anomalies, making them
essential tools for exploratory data analysis.

## Two-Variable Graph {.smaller}

::::: columns

![](images/12.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Scatter Plot** shows all the data on the plot, you can see the
    distribution, correlations, and the spread of the data between two
    variables

-   **Line Plot** similar to scatter plot but the points are connected,
    make it easier to see the trends and evolution

-   **2D Histogram** shows distribution of two variables related to each
    other

-   **Box or Whisker Plot** shows spread of data and statistical
    information
:::
:::::

::: notes
Two-variable visualization, also known as **bivariate visualization**,
is used to explore the relationship between two different variables. The
choice of visualization depends on the type of data—whether both
variables are numerical, categorical, or a mix of both.

One of the most common ways to visualize two numerical variables is a
**scatter plot**, which displays individual data points on a graph with
one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. This helps
identify correlations, trends, or clusters in the data. For example, a
scatter plot can show whether an increase in one variable leads to an
increase or decrease in another.

Another effective visualization is a **box plot (or box-and-whisker
plot)**, which provides a summary of the data's median, quartiles, and
potential outliers. It is particularly useful for detecting variability
and spotting extreme values.

By using these techniques, we can better understand how two variables
interact, uncover trends, and gain deeper insights from the data.

-   **Heatmap** shows two variables and other quantity (amount,
    intensity, height) with a colormap

-   **Multiple-variable bar plot** shows multiple variables for multiple
    groups

For high-dimensional datasets, applying the t-Distributed Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and alike to reduce the dimension.

::: notes
When we analyze data, sometimes we need to explore the relationship
between three different variables simultaneously. This is called
**multivariate visualization**, and it helps us uncover more complex
patterns and interactions that might not be visible with just one or two
variables.

One common method for visualizing three variables is a **bubble chart**.
A bubble chart is similar to a scatter plot, where two numerical
variables are plotted on the x and y axes, but a third variable is
represented by the size of the bubbles. For example, if we were
analyzing cities, the x-axis could represent population, the y-axis
could represent average income, and the bubble size could represent the
crime rate.

Another useful visualization is the **3D scatter plot**, which extends a
regular scatter plot by adding a third axis (z-axis). This is helpful
when we want to see how three numerical variables interact, but it can
sometimes be difficult to interpret without interactive tools.

When both variables are categorical, a **stacked bar chart** or a
**heatmap** is useful. These visualizations display how frequently
different categories appear together, helping identify patterns and
relationships in the data. For a combination of categorical and
numerical variables, a **stacked bar chart** can be effective. Here, the
x-axis might represent categories (e.g., different product types), the
y-axis could show total sales, and the bars can be divided into segments
representing a third categorical variable, such as different regions.

Using three-variable visualizations allows us to gain deeper insights
into data relationships, helping us make more informed decisions and
detect more complex trends.
