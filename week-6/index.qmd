In this module, we will learn more about data visualization and the
basics behind it. Visualization is an essential part of exploratory data
analysis, enabling faster comprehension, better decision-making, and
more impactful storytelling with data.

Text analysis is not just about collecting data, it's about transforming
raw data into meaningful insights, knowledge, and ultimately, impact.
However, misinterpretation or excessive manipulation can lead to
misleading conclusions.

Data visualization helps the user make sense of large (and often times
small) amounts of data using computational and analytic tools. In
academic and special libraries data visualization helps researchers and
business users recognize and understand the “patterns” in the data to
assist them in decision making, research, product development,
marketing, and other uses not yet realized.

Along with the emergence of “big data” came the need for more visual
means to analyze and make sense of the data. Visualization also allows
for re-purposing of datasets beyond their original use.

Information professionals assist in data visualization but also in
managing and preparing the data for use.

An academic library may title these professionals as Data analysis
librarian, Data manager, Digital Projects librarian/specialist, etc. The
titles are emerging as fast as the visualization tools themselves.
Special librarians have always conducted data analysis and competitive
intelligence for their companies. Data visualization is an extension of
this service to their user community.

Information professionals also use data visualization themselves for
innovative ways to present information to users, to market their
services, and to synthesize data for stakeholders.

The saying *"A picture is worth a thousand words"* holds true in data
analysis because our brains are naturally wired to process visual
information quickly and efficiently.

Instead of sifting through raw numbers, visual representations such as
graphs, charts, and plots help us absorb information at a glance.

Through visualization, we can easily identify patterns, trends, and
outliers through thoughtful visual **encoding** that might otherwise be
overlooked in tabular data. It allows us to connect the dots between
different variables, uncover hidden relationships, and gain meaningful
insights.

Additionally, visualization is a valuable tool for sharing findings, as
it makes complex data more accessible and engaging for others.

Whether presenting data to a technical audience or a general audience,
clear and well-designed visuals help communicate insights effectively
and capture attention.

In this lecture, we will explore:

-   The journey from raw data to actionable insights
-   How to structure and interpret data effectively
-   Turning insights into meaningful decisions

Please note that throughout this lecture, when I use the term “data,” I
am using it as a broad, umbrella term. In this context, it explicitly
includes textual data (such as documents, social media posts, articles,
transcripts, and any other forms of text) that we analyze using IR, NLP,
or text mining techniques.

Humans are biologically wired for visual processing where good visualization design works with human perception — using pre-attentive features to guide attention, reveal patterns, and make complex information easier to understand.

Research shows that a substantial portion of the human brain is devoted to processing visual information. Our visual system can process enormous amounts of data extremely quickly — estimates suggest up to 10 million bits per second. That means we are naturally optimized to detect patterns, differences, movement, and contrast almost instantly.

This biological wiring explains why visualizations are so powerful. When we encode data visually, we are tapping into one of the brain’s strongest processing systems.

The second image on the slide highlights something called pre-attentive processing. This refers to the brain’s ability to rapidly detect certain visual features before we consciously focus our attention.

Notice the small grid examples. In each case, one element “pops out” immediately — perhaps because of a different color hue, brightness, orientation, texture, position, size, or shape. You do not have to scan carefully to find it. Your brain detects it almost instantly.

These features — color, orientation, texture, alignment, brightness, saturation, size, and shape — are known as pre-attentive attributes. They are processed automatically and quickly by our visual system.

This is why thoughtful encoding is so powerful. When we use visual attributes strategically, we reduce cognitive effort and guide attention intentionally. Instead of forcing someone to read through numbers or text, we allow the brain to recognize differences instantly.

However, this also means that poor design can mislead attention. If everything is highlighted, nothing stands out. If color is used inconsistently, it creates confusion rather than clarity.

So when we say “we are wired for visualization,” we mean that effective visualizations align with how the brain naturally processes information. They leverage perception instead of fighting against it.

## How Encoding Works?

Guess how many '7s' there are in this set

:::notes
Now, lets explore a very important concept in visualization: `encoding`.

On this slide, you see a large grid of numbers, and I ask you: How many 7s are there?

At first glance, this feels difficult. The numbers all look the same. They are the same color, same size, same weight. Nothing stands out visually. Your brain has to scan each character individually, which takes time and effort.
:::

## How Encoding Works? {.smaller}

`Effective visualizations require thoughtful encoding`

`Design decisions have a big impact on what people will see in the data`

Now, try guessing again.

They are the same set of numbers but now the 7's pop out to us.

![](images/17.png)


:::notes
Now look at the this image.

It is the exact same set of numbers. Nothing has changed in the data itself. But this time, the 7s are highlighted in a different color.

Suddenly, the task becomes much easier. The 7s “pop out” to us. We can estimate or count them much more quickly.

What changed? The **encoding** changed.

Encoding refers to how data is visually represented — through color, size, position, shape, contrast, or other visual attributes. In the second image, color was used as a visual encoding to differentiate the 7s from the other numbers.

This simple change demonstrates a powerful principle: Effective visualizations require thoughtful encoding.

Design decisions — such as which colors to use, what to highlight, how to group elements, or what to make prominent — dramatically influence what people notice and how quickly they understand the information.

The data did not change. Only the visual encoding changed. Yet our perception changed significantly.

This example also reinforces an earlier idea: visualizations are not neutral. The way we encode data shapes what viewers see first, what stands out, and what might be overlooked.

So when creating visualizations, we must carefully consider:
- What do we want the viewer to notice?
- What comparisons should be easy?
- What patterns should stand out?

Good encoding reduces cognitive load and guides attention intentionally. Encoding is the bridge between raw data and human perception. The choices we make in encoding determine how effectively our audience can interpret and understand the data.

## Why Create Visualizations Generally? {.smaller}

`Most information visualizations are acts of interpretation masquerading as presentation. In other words, they are images that act as if they are just showing us what is, but in actuality, they are arguments made in graphical form (Johanna Drucker)`

:::

::: notes
We create visualizations to answer questions and sometimes even to discover new questions. Visualizations help us make decisions, see data in context, expand our memory, support graphical reasoning, identify patterns, present arguments, tell stories, and even inspire action.

Visualizations are not just decorative. They are cognitive tools. They help us process complex information more efficiently than raw tables or text ever could.

Some goals are about attention and beauty — getting people to read, attracting different types of learners, and making the work engaging. Other goals focus on understanding — helping people explain, interpret, and explore data. And finally, some goals move toward implication — proving a point, correcting misconceptions, evoking emotion, or encouraging action.

This brings us to the quote on this slide by Johanna Drucker:

“Most information visualizations are acts of interpretation masquerading as presentation. In other words, they are images that act as if they are just showing us what is, but in actuality, they are arguments made in graphical form.”

This is a powerful statement. It reminds us that visualizations are not neutral. They are not simply transparent windows into data. Every choice we make — what data to include, what scale to use, what colors to apply, what to highlight, what to omit — reflects interpretation.

A visualization might appear objective, but it always carries assumptions, framing decisions, and design choices. In that sense, every visualization is an argument. It persuades the viewer to see the data in a certain way.

As creators of visualizations, especially in academic and research settings, we must be mindful of this. We are not just presenting data — we are shaping how others understand it.

So as we move forward in this course, I want you to think critically about both sides:
How can visualizations help us understand and communicate complex information?
And how might they also influence, frame, or even bias interpretation?

Data visualization is not isolated. It connects rigorous analysis with thoughtful communication, balancing discovery and storytelling depending on your purpose and audience. This slide illustrates the relationship between Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Information Design, and how they exist along a spectrum from exploratory to explanatory work.

On the left side, we have Data Analysis. This is primarily exploratory. Here, the goal is to investigate the data, test hypotheses, discover patterns, and identify insights. The audience is often the analyst themselves or a small research team. The focus is on depth, accuracy, and discovery rather than presentation polish.

In the center, we see Data Visualization. This is the bridge between analysis and design. Visualization serves both exploratory and explanatory purposes. During exploration, visualizations help analysts see patterns, trends, and anomalies more clearly. During explanation, those same or refined visualizations are used to communicate findings to others.

On the right side, we have Information Design, which leans more toward explanatory work. Here, the focus shifts to communication. The goal is not just to analyze data, but to present it in a clear, engaging, and accessible way for a broader audience. This is where storytelling, layout, typography, and aesthetics play a stronger role.

The overlap between Data Visualization and Information Design is where we often see infographics. Infographics prioritize explanation and communication, sometimes simplifying or summarizing analysis to make it digestible and compelling for a general audience.

The arrow at the top emphasizes that visualization exists on a continuum. Some visualizations are created for exploration — messy, iterative, and analytical. Others are carefully designed for explanation — polished, curated, and persuasive.

Understanding where your work sits on this spectrum is important. Are you exploring data to discover insights? Or are you explaining insights to others? The answer affects your design choices, level of detail, and presentation style.

::: notes
Data visualization comes in various forms, each serving a specific
purpose depending on the type of data being analyzed and the insights we
seek. There are many types of visualization that you can choose from
once you know more about your data after the EDA process.

Some of the most common ones are:

1.  **Histograms** display the distribution of numerical data, helping
    us understand the frequency and spread of values.

2.  **Bar charts** are useful for comparing categorical data, showing
    differences between groups or trends over time.

3.  **Pie charts** are commonly used for showing proportions, though
    they are best for simple comparisons rather than detailed analysis.

4.  **Line charts** are effective for tracking changes and trends,
    especially in time-series data.

5.  **Scatter plots** help visualize relationships between two numerical
    variables, making it easier to identify correlations and patterns.

6.  More advanced visualizations include **heatmaps**, which use color
    intensity to represent data values and highlight patterns across a
    matrix, and **box plots**, which summarize data distribution,
    outliers, and variability.

7.  **Tree maps** and **word clouds** are great for hierarchical and
    text-based data, respectively.

Choosing the right visualization depends on the data and the story we
want to tell, as each type enhances our ability to interpret information
and make informed decisions.

-   **Histogram** shows distribution and concentration of data

-   **Bar Plot** compares the same variable across different groups and
    shows how the data distributed among the groups

-   **Pie Chart** shows the groups of what your data is made, allows you
    to see the most and least as well as everything in-between, and
    shows the distribution of the data among groups

::: notes
One-variable visualization, also known as **univariate visualization**,
focuses on analyzing a single variable to understand its distribution,
central tendency, and spread. A common method for visualizing
one-variable data is a **histogram**, which groups numerical data into
bins and displays the frequency of values within each bin. This helps us
see patterns such as whether the data is normally distributed, skewed,
or contains outliers.

**Bar charts** are another option when dealing with categorical data,
showing the frequency of different categories using bars of varying
heights.

Using these visualizations, we can quickly interpret key characteristics
of a dataset, such as its shape, spread, and any anomalies, making them
essential tools for exploratory data analysis.

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Scatter Plot** shows all the data on the plot, you can see the
    distribution, correlations, and the spread of the data between two
    variables

-   **Line Plot** similar to scatter plot but the points are connected,
    make it easier to see the trends and evolution

-   **2D Histogram** shows distribution of two variables related to each
    other

-   **Box or Whisker Plot** shows spread of data and statistical
    information

::: notes
Two-variable visualization, also known as **bivariate visualization**,
is used to explore the relationship between two different variables. The
choice of visualization depends on the type of data—whether both
variables are numerical, categorical, or a mix of both.

One of the most common ways to visualize two numerical variables is a
**scatter plot**, which displays individual data points on a graph with
one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. This helps
identify correlations, trends, or clusters in the data. For example, a
scatter plot can show whether an increase in one variable leads to an
increase or decrease in another.

Another effective visualization is a **box plot (or box-and-whisker
plot)**, which provides a summary of the data's median, quartiles, and
potential outliers. It is particularly useful for detecting variability
and spotting extreme values.

By using these techniques, we can better understand how two variables
interact, uncover trends, and gain deeper insights from the data.

## Three Variable Graph {.smaller}

::::: columns

-   **Heatmap** shows two variables and other quantity (amount,
    intensity, height) with a colormap

-   **Multiple-variable bar plot** shows multiple variables for multiple
    groups

For high-dimensional datasets, applying the t-Distributed Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and alike to reduce the dimension.

::: notes
When we analyze data, sometimes we need to explore the relationship
between three different variables simultaneously. This is called
**multivariate visualization**, and it helps us uncover more complex
patterns and interactions that might not be visible with just one or two
variables.

One common method for visualizing three variables is a **bubble chart**.
A bubble chart is similar to a scatter plot, where two numerical
variables are plotted on the x and y axes, but a third variable is
represented by the size of the bubbles. For example, if we were
analyzing cities, the x-axis could represent population, the y-axis
could represent average income, and the bubble size could represent the
crime rate.

Another useful visualization is the **3D scatter plot**, which extends a
regular scatter plot by adding a third axis (z-axis). This is helpful
when we want to see how three numerical variables interact, but it can
sometimes be difficult to interpret without interactive tools.

When both variables are categorical, a **stacked bar chart** or a
**heatmap** is useful. These visualizations display how frequently
different categories appear together, helping identify patterns and
relationships in the data. For a combination of categorical and
numerical variables, a **stacked bar chart** can be effective. Here, the
x-axis might represent categories (e.g., different product types), the
y-axis could show total sales, and the bars can be divided into segments
representing a third categorical variable, such as different regions.

Using three-variable visualizations allows us to gain deeper insights
into data relationships, helping us make more informed decisions and
detect more complex trends.
