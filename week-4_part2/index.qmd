# Introduction


## Key Criteria for Corpus Design

1.  General purpose vs specialized
2. Dynamic (monitor) vs static
3.  Representativeness and balance
4.  Size
5.  Collection and Permission
6.  Text capture and markup
7.  Storage and Access

## Criteria 1: General vs Specialised Purpose

-   Probably obvious how to assemble specialized corpus: appropriateness
    of texts for inclusion is self-defined
-   General-purpose corpus implies very careful planning to ensure
    balance
-   Implies making some assumptions about the nature of language, even
    though that may go against the grain

## Criteria 2: Dynamic vs Static

-   Static corpus will give a snapshot of language use at a given time
    -   Easier to control balance of content
    -   May limit usefulness, esp. as time passes
-   Dynamic corpus ever-changing
    -   Called “monitor” corpus because allows us to monitor language
        change over time
    -   But more or less impossible to ensure balance

## Criteria 3: Representative and balance {.smaller}

`Planned balance: Example of British National Corpus (BNC)`

-   Sampling and representativeness very difficult to ensure
    -   BNC designers very explicit about their assumptions
    -   Acknowledge that many decisions are subjective in the end
-   100m words of contemporary spoken and written British English
-   Representative of British English “as a whole”
-   Balanced with regard to genre, subject matter and style
-   Also designed to be appropriate for a variety of uses: lexicography,
    education, research, commercial applications (computational tools)

## Criteria 4: Size {.smaller}

`Length of Corpus`

-   Resources available to create and manage corpus determine how long
    it can be
    -   Funding, researchers, computing facilities
-   Speech is easy to capture, but much more time-consuming to process
    than written language
-   Length is also determined on use to which it will be put
-   Corpora for lexicographic use need to be (much) bigger
    -   Early corpora (1m words) seemed huge, mainly due to limitations
        of computers to process them
    -   Sinclair (1991) described a 20m word corpus as “small but
        nevertheless useful”
    -   Even in a billion-word corpus, data for some words/constructions
        would be sparse

## Criteria 4: Size {.smaller}

`Token`

-   A token is the smallest unit that a corpus consists of
-   A token normally refers to:
    -   a word form: *going, trees, Mary, twenty-five…*
    -   punctuation: *comma, dot, question mark, quotes…*
    -   digit: *50,000…*
    -   abbreviations, product names: *3M, i600, XP, FB…*
    -   anything else between spaces

## Criteria 4: Size {.smaller}

`Token vs Type`

> The term "token" refers to the total number of words in a text, corpus
> etc, regardless of how often they are repeated

> The term "type" refers to the number of distinct words in a text,
> corpus etc.

The sentence "a good food is a food that you like" contains nine tokens,
but only seven types, as "a" and “food" are repeated

## Criteria 5: Collection and Permission {.smaller}

`Collecting samples of speech`

-   Aim to collect natural samples
-   Cannot tape record surreptitiously
    -   Early corpora were done in this way, with permission sought
        afterwards
    -   Nowadays regarded as unethical, perhaps even illegal
-   “Observer’s paradox”: presence of recorder effects behaviour
-   Can be overcome (somewhat) by recording lots of material and
    sampling from the middle

## Criteria 5: Collection and Permission {.smaller}

`Collecting written samples`

-   Much easier to obtain, but beware important issue of `permission`
    -   Copyrighted material cannot be freely stored and distributed
    -   “Fair use” law allows use of up to 2,000 words for private
        research
    -   Corpus samples are often \>2,000 words, and often distributed
        widely, sometimes for profit
    -   Copyright laws may differ between countries

## Criteria 5: Collection and Permission {.smaller}

`Permission`

-   Can be quite onerous obtaining copyright permission for text
    analysis
    -   Time consuming to wait for a reply to a request
    -   Big risk

## Criteria 6: Text Capture and Markup {.smaller}

-   Easiest if text is already machine-readable, though there may still
    be some issues with mark-up
    -   eg markup text obtained from publishers may have print
        formatting information embedded in it
    -   text captured from an online source may have HTML mark-up
-   If text exists in printed form, scanning is a possibility
    -   OCR is generally very good quality material printed since 1990s,
        but text must still be carefully checked
    -   Issue of how to deal with printing effects such as hyphenation,
        headers and footers, footnotes
    -   Issues with hand-written text, typed-written, or with annotation

## Criteria 6: Text Capture -\> re-keying {.smaller}

-   If OCR is not suitable/available
    -   eg hand-written texts, or medium is not flat
-   Re-keying is only option
-   Highly expensive, time-consuming and error-prone
-   With manuscripts, there may be an issue of “keyboarder correction”
    -   Example of Learner English corpus of handwritten essays:
        important not to correct “errors”
    -   PhD student collected handwritten essays by (Arabic) learners of
        English for error analysis: first task was to “type them in”

## Example: Speech Corpus {.smaller}

- Here corpus is transcribed speech data
- Many issues surrounding transcription of speech
- Some of them similar to issues with handwriting
- Others particular to speech

`Transcribing Speech`

- Not just a matter of typing in what was said, though this is of course a major element
  - And may not be straightforward
  - How much “correction” to do in transcription
  - eg of hesitations, false starts, and other speech phenomena

## Example: Speech Corpus {.smaller}
`Transcribing Speech` (Cont.)

- Speech corpora usually encode information about paralinguistic and non-linguistic features
  - Speed of delivery, pauses
  - Loudness (whispering, shouting, singing) 
  - Coughs and other non-speech sounds which may be meaningful (grunt, tutting, hesitation noises)
  - Even outside noises if relevant (eg passing siren, music, animals), as they might “contribute” to the discussion
- How to transcribe contractions like gotta, gonna, sorta, …
  - Notice how some are completely conventional, eg can’t, won’t
- How (and whether) to transcribe partially uttered words and repetitions
- How to represent unintelligible speech


##  Criteria 6: Text Capture and Markup {.smaller}

`Markup`

- Issues shown in last few slides can be overcome by `mark-up`
- Annotate the text to show explicitly where there is anything special
  - Doubtful text
  - Incorrect text (mark up can show what was probably meant)
  - Extraneous material
- This is also an important issue in computer storage of ancient manuscripts

## Criteria 7: Storage and Access {.smaller}

`Storage`

-   Where will the data be kept, and who will have access?
  - If corpus is for public distribution, will it be by license, or freely available?
  - If by license, distribute online (with password) or USB flash drive?
- Nowadays, fortunately, size is not such an issue though
  - Big corpora have to be distributed on multiple USB flash drive or external drives
  - Downloading from a website can take hours
- Note that it is not only the corpus data that must be distributed
  - Many corpora have associated software packages to facilitate exploration
  - For speech corpora, original recordings may be available

## Criteria 7: Storage and Access {.smaller}

`Access`

- Efficient access to corpus data comes hand-in-hand with corpus structure
- No good having structured corpus if that structure can’t be used to delimit searches
- Best if corpus is cross-indexed on all searchable criteria, ie all details that are encoded in headers
